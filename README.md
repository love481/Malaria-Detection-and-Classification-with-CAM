Classify and detect Malaria using custom CNN and EfficientNet with Class Activation Map


## Requirements:
* torch >=1.8.1+cpu
* efficientnet_pytorch
* numpy
* matplotlib
* math

## Installation
Run this command on command prompt to clone the repository


`git clone https://github.com/love481/Malaria-Detection-and-Classification-with-CAM.git`
